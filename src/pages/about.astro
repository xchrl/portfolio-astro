      <p>
        as mentioned previously, i am a front-end developer that had to learn
        most of the technologies used nowadays myself. i started programming
        back when i was somewhere around 12 - that's when i made first, pretty
        basic games with unity. afterwards, i decided to go to a school that
        specializes in IT, which helped me understand more concepts surrounding
        the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        but that's not all! aside from IT, i am a huge sucker for gaming.
        whether it's fps, psychological horrors, gacha, you name it - i probably
        play it. especially psychological horrors - my main genre of games since
        about august 2023 ago, but ever since i tried games like OMORI, needy
        streamer overload, end roll, etc., i instantly fell in love. usually,
        you can find me in genshin, zenless, wuthering waves, arknights, blue
        archive, girls frontline 2, counter strike, rocket league or rematch.
      </p>
      <p>
        other than programming and gaming, i dab a little bit in running! my
        current goal is to run the distance of a half-marathon (21km) until the
        end of 2025.
